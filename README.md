Testing Instructions

Default Light Mode:

Clear local storage (Developer Tools > Application > Storage > Local Storage > Clear).
Reload the page and verify the app opens in light mode (background should be light, theme icon should be üåô).
Click the theme toggle button to switch to dark mode and back, ensuring the icon changes (üåô ‚Üî ‚òÄÔ∏è).
Reload the page to confirm the saved theme is applied.


User Guide Modal:

Clear local storage to simulate first visit.
Reload the page and verify the user guide modal appears automatically.
Close the modal using the "‡¶¨‡¶®‡ßç‡¶ß ‡¶ï‡¶∞‡ßÅ‡¶®" button and reload to ensure it doesn't reappear.
Click the "‡¶¨‡ßç‡¶Ø‡¶¨‡¶π‡¶æ‡¶∞ ‡¶¨‡¶ø‡¶ß‡¶ø" button to reopen the modal.
Test on mobile and desktop to ensure the modal is responsive and scrollable.


Other Features:

Debugging Tips

Dark Mode Issues:

Check console for errors (e.g., "Error toggling theme").
Clear local storage and verify default light mode.
Ensure styles.css is generated (npm run build).
In Brave, disable Shields temporarily.


User Guide Modal Issues:

Check console for errors (e.g., "Error showing user guide modal").
Clear local storage to test first-time modal display.
Verify the "‡¶¨‡ßç‡¶Ø‡¶¨‡¶π‡¶æ‡¶∞ ‡¶¨‡¶ø‡¶ß‡¶ø" button works.


General Issues:

Ensure Node.js is installed and npm install was successful.
Run npm run build if styles are missing.
Check console logs for any JavaScript errors.



Notes

Data is stored in the browser's local storage. Clearing storage will reset expenses and settings.
For production, consider hosting on platforms like Netlify or GitHub Pages.
If you encounter issues with Node.js setup, a pre-generated styles.css can be provided.
